Nozzle Instructions

1.1 Z-value

Go to SETTING and then click LEVELING. Click on Delta Z Height, and click RETURN and MOVE.

Adjust the steps to 0.1mm on the touchscreen. Put a piece of paper between the nozzle and the print head. Then click
and continue clicking on -Z while moving the paper back and forth. When you feel a slight of resistance from the paper
your Z-value has been determinedly. Write this Z-value down in machine settings in Cura.

Remove the screws that are attached to the printer head and loosen the trays that are connected to the inductive
sensor. Spin the tray until there is a gap according to the photo.

Take 8 slides of sheet and put over the bed. Bring the printer head to the base (causing the nozzle to be in the bed), hold
the inductive sensor down and tighten the upper tray as shown in the photo.

The last step is to hold the tray from above, and tighten the tray from below.

Correct Z-offset value.

A larger Z-offset value. The nozzle is too close to the print bed.

A smaller Z-offset value. The nozzle is too far away from the print bed.

1.2 Nozzle Instructions
In this first picture we can see a nozzle that need to be replaced. The first step is to assembly your new nozzle, and
remove the old one, as you can see in the picture below.

When you have done the assembly of the nozzle, put the cables in to the holes like in the picture below. Then mount the
nozzle to the print head and put the cables carefully through the hole like the picture below.

Before you tighten the screws for the nozzle make sure that it is properly attached, move the nozzle back and forth and
make sure that the screws are in the track before tightening them.
